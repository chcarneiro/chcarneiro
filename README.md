**Hi there**

Electronics Engineer, 36 years old and founder of Seizerteck, passionate about innovative projects in industrial automation, applied artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and computer vision. In this space, I share projects developed with TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and a focus on embedded AI. Explore studies on model quantization, intelligent sensors, and experiments with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM for predictive maintenance. Also, follow the development of prototypes for IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), and smart city solutions. My main technologies include Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, Embedded Linux, IoT, Deep Learning, Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning.
